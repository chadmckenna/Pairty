Pairty (pronounced "Pear" + "tee", similar to "Party") is an app built in Ruby on _why's 
Bloopsaphone and Portaudio.

How it works:
First, you need to get Bloopsaphone (find on github here: https://github.com/viking/bloopsaphone).
This page also gives all the information necessary to get Portaudio and get it running on your
machine. Once you have that you're ready to rock (literally). Pairty is currently in early stages
of development, but the idea is that its basically a sequencer. But instead of simply controlling
midi, it actually generates the sounds directly from your sound card; so its more like an 
instrument than a sequencer. 

To run, simply clone the repository, navigate into the directory, and run:

>> ruby rocker.rb party_rock.yml

Thats it! And you don't have to use party_rock.yml if you don't want, but its a great place to start.
Pretty much any YAML file that contains the basic format in party_rock.yml works. What's also really
cool about Pairty is the fact that its dynamic. To get the most out of Pairty open up party_rock.yml 
(or whatever YAML file you're playing) in your favorite text editor and make any changes to the file.
Once you have made your changes, simply save the file and any changes that were made to the YAML file
will automatically get sent to Pairty for the next loop in your sequence. This allows the user to
change up the beat of the music as it plays. 

Give it a try!
